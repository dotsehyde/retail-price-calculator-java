## Retail price calculator

### Written in Java 

Write a program that asks the user to enter an item’s wholesale cost and its markup percent- 
age. It should then display the item’s retail price. For example:

• If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage	is 100 percent, then the item’s retail price is 10.00.
• If an	item’s	wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 percent, then the item’s retail price is 7.50.

The program should have a method named calculateRetail that receives the wholesale 
cost and the markup percentage as arguments, and returns the retail price of the item.
